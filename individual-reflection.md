    - Answer: It has a class called `SlackAPIError` to handle the exception with the error and comment: "We encountered a problem".

    - Answer: Headers(Content-Type, charset), and body(token, channel and text).
1. What is the syntax used to make this request? (Copy and paste a code snippet here)
    - Answer:
      ```ruby
      # Copy and paste your answer below this comment
        base_url = "https://slack.com/api/"
        post_url = "#{base_url}/chat.postMessage"

        resp = HTTParty.post(post_url,{
          headers: { 'Content-Type'=> 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
            'charset' => 'utf-8' },
          body:{
            token: ENV["SLACK_API_TOKEN"],
            channel: channel,
            text: message
          }
        })

## Request & Response Cycle

Imagine this situation: A human user, Grace, opens up Terminal and runs in the command line `$ ruby lib/slack.rb`. When the program runs, she types "list channels."

There are two actors:
  - the human user, Grace, and their computer that runs `slack.rb`
  - Slack API

Based on the project requirements, when Grace enters "list channels,"
1. What is the request being made in the program?
    - Answer: Use GET, endpoint `"https://slack.com/api/channels.list"`
1. Who is the client?
    - Answer: Grace computer running `slack.rb`
1. Who is the server?
    - Answer: The endpoint `channels.list` it defines requestâ€“response message system, expressed in JSON.

## Part 2: Optional Refactoring

If your reflection inspired you to make minimal changes to your Slack CLI implementation (more project requirements or refactoring) then do so now, and describe what you did in a few sentences.

**Spend no more than 3 hours on this step.**

**Do not write or add more than 50 lines of code (including tests).**

**Push your changes to GitHub from your original Slack CLI Program.**

### Describe your optional Slack CLI changes here

Answer: For the POST request, I did not take into account when the message could not be sent. I wrote an If statement to handle the error, File: `recipiente.rb` line: 39 to 42. Including `SlackAPIError, "We encountered a problem:` Also I wrote the test for these lines. File: `recipient_test.rb` lines: 52 to 59.
